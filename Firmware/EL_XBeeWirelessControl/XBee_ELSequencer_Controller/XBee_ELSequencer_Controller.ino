Remote Push Button Controller for EL Sequencer w/ XBee Series 1

Description:
This is a basic test of the EL Sequencer with a wireless controller.
The wireless controller consists of an Arduino Uno, XBee Explorer,
XBee Series 1 transceiver, and LED Push Button. The EL Sequencer
uses an EL component, EL inverter, XBee female sockets soldered,
battery, and a XBee Series 1 transceiver. An XBee Series 2
can be used but the throughput of the Series 1 is much higher. To
reduce latency, I recommend using the XBee Series 1. The basic
configuration of the XBee module with point-to-point configuratin is
based on Digi's Example tutorial for "Basic XBee 802.15.4 (Series 1) Chat"
=> https://www.digi.com/blog/xbee/basic-xbee-802-15-4-chat/ .
Page 5 of the tutorial shows you how to broadcast with
point-to-multipoint configuration so that multiple EL Sequencers
can be controlled.

Connect the XBee Explorer to the Arduino:
     GND = GND
     3.3V = 3.3V
     DOUT (i.e. Tx of XBee) = Pin 2 (Rx on Arduino)
     DIN (i.e. Rx of XBee)= Pin 3 (Tx on Arduino)

By pushing the button, a character is sent from a remote microcontroller.
The corresponding EL Sequencer will receive the character and control
the EL component on a channel that is associated with that character.
A LED push button was used but not necessary for this to operate. A
normal momentary push button can be used.

Connect momentary LED tactile push buttons to Arduino:
     C = pin 13, the cathode (+) of the LED
     A = GND, the anode (-) of the LED
     B1 = GND
     B2 = pin 8
     
Using an Arduino Uno, the XBee transceiver is connected to the 
Software Serial pins. By pushing the button, the Arduino will
send one character through the XBee. Logic is used to control
how many characters are sent with the push button. The Arduino
will not send another character until the button is pressed again.

NOte: This section of the code can be optimized. As the user is not 
pressing down on the button, logic can be added so that the XBee is
not continuously sending serial characters to the receiving 
EL Sequencer when idle.

    digitalWrite(ledPin1, HIGH); //turn push button LED ON
    current_button1State = true; // button has been pressed once
    
    if(prev_button1State != current_button1State)//check to see if button is still being pressed
    {   
      Serial.println("Button is pressed.");
      xbee.write("A");//Tell Sequencer to change to mode
    }
